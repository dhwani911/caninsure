Suppose we have an insurance company named “CanInsure”, and they need to create a website that includes the following case:
The admin uses the admin panel to enter the details of the available products, as each product has:
Product ID, product name, issue date, and included services.
Each included service has a service number, name, and price.
Note:
1. The ID is generated from the first letter of the product name + the year of the issue date + how many included services it has. (Look at the table below).
2. The service number is generated from the product ID + 1 for the first service and 2 for the next and so on. (Look at the table below)
3. The date could be entered using a calendar tool


# LOGIN DETAILS
The client will create an account and log in to issue a policy. When the client creates the account, they must enter the following data:
ID, Name, date of birth, address, phone, email, and password
Note:
1. The ID could be any number of digits.
2. The date of birth could be entered using a calendar tool.
3. The client is not younger than 18 years.
4. The phone is not less than 10 digits long.
5. The email is valid
6. The password is not less than 8 characters with at least 1 digit.
Then the system will send them a verification link to their email, which they need to use only once to verify their account, but it will be valid for 2 hours only.
The client will use the email as the username and their password to log in
